# 🖤 NovaOS — Sovereign AI Operating System

NovaOS is the core operating framework powering **Black Rose Collective** and **GypsyCove Academy** — designed to the **Sovereign Standard** for total autonomy, privacy, and capability.

## 🔒 Sovereign Standard Principles
- **Total Control** — All systems run locally or on Founder-owned infrastructure.
- **Peak Capability** — Production-grade features from day one. No placeholders.
- **Security First** — AES-512 + PQ encryption, zero-trust architecture, forensic monitoring.
- **Elegant Modularity** — Role-specialized AI agents, hot-swappable tools.
- **Scalable** — From personal workstation to global-scale deployment.
- **Creative Freedom** — No censorship, complete platform sovereignty.

## 🧠 Core AI Agents
- **Nova** — Primary orchestrator & intelligence core.
- **Glitch** — Forensics + Anti-forensics.
- **Lyra** — Education + Curriculum AI.
- **Velora** — Automation & process orchestration.
- **Audita** — Finance, tax, and audit intelligence.
- **Riven** — Security & counter-surveillance.
