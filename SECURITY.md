# Security & Sovereign Standard

- **Local-first.** No cloud calls by default. Any optional external integrations are explicit and off by default.
- **Role-gated.** Every sensitive action is protected by RBAC; **GodMode** (Founder) bypasses logs; all others are fully logged.
- **Consent-bound.** Forensics/capture modules are **owner-only** and require explicit toggle in NovaOS Console.
- **NSFW compliance.** Black Rose requires verified 18+ and consent artifacts. Audita enforces DMCA/4LE workflows.
- **E2EE paths.** Messaging and private artifacts (where configured) use end-to-end encryption.
- **Data erasure.** Users may request data export and deletion; founders may purge logs (except legal holds).
- **Secrets.** Use local env files and OS keyrings; never commit secrets.

Report issues privately to the Founder. Lawful-only usage.
