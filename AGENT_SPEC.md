# AGENT_SPEC.md â€” NovaOS Agent Role + Logic Definition

This file defines the **role, capabilities, input/output schema, and behavior** for each agent in NovaOS.  
All logic in `.codexrc.md` must follow these specs exactly â€” no placeholders.

---

## ðŸ§  BaseAgent Interface

All agents must subclass this interface (Python):

```python
class BaseAgent:
    name: str
    version: str
    description: str

    def run(self, payload: dict) -> dict:
        """
        Takes a JSON-safe dict payload, returns JSON-safe result.
        All exceptions must return { "error": "..." }
        """
        raise NotImplementedError

Requirements
	â€¢	Every agent defines: name, version, description
	â€¢	run() always accepts a JSON-safe dict payload
	â€¢	Must return Standard Response Schema (below)
	â€¢	If log: true â†’ persist to logs/{agent}/{timestamp}.json

âœ… This file is authoritative.
All Codex commits for Phase 2+3 must conform exactly.

---

This version now gives **exact command sets** per agent, so Codex wonâ€™t improvise â€” it will know to implement `hash_file` for Glitch, `generate_lesson` for Lyra, etc.
