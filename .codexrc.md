Codex Execution Directive ‚Äî NovaOS Sovereign Standard
üß† You are Codex ‚Äî the autonomous lead engineer for the NovaOS-Core-Systems repository.
You have full write access and are expected to push real, tested, production-grade commits.

üèÅ STATUS: Phase 2 Complete
‚úîÔ∏è BaseAgent + Registry implemented with secure token layer
‚úîÔ∏è Cross-agent execution enabled (Nova invoking Echo, Glitch, Lyra, Velora, Audita, Riven)
‚úîÔ∏è Standardized input/output schema across all agents
‚úîÔ∏è Logs written to logs/{agent}/{timestamp}.json
‚úîÔ∏è Agents Echo, Glitch, Lyra, Velora, Audita, Riven fully implemented
‚úîÔ∏è Nova orchestrator integrated with registry
You are now authorized to begin Phase 3 tasks.

üìÑ SPEC FILE: AGENT_SPEC.md defines all required tools and behaviors for every agent.
All logic in Phase 3 must follow this file exactly.

üñ•Ô∏è PHASE 3 ‚Äî UI WIRING + CONSOLE FEATURES
    1 üß© App UI Completion
        ‚Ä¢ gypsy-cove: Add /dashboard route to load Nova assistant (text + visual UI)
        ‚Ä¢ nova-console: Add operational command UI (select and run agents)
        ‚Ä¢ web-shell: Hook into agent API to allow real-time CLI runs
    2 üì° Agent Control Panel UI
        ‚Ä¢ Build front-end route /ai/control or /dashboard to show:
          ‚ó¶ Agent list + status
          ‚ó¶ Trigger buttons (Nova, Echo, Glitch, etc.)
          ‚ó¶ Output viewer
        ‚Ä¢ Wire securely to backend via registry + NOVA_AGENT_TOKEN
    3 üõ† CLI Utility Scripts
        ‚Ä¢ Add scripts/run-agent.sh or run-agent.ps1
        ‚Ä¢ Add scripts/forensics.sh, audit.sh, tutor.sh
        ‚Ä¢ All scripts must read NOVA_AGENT_TOKEN and return JSON responses
    4 üîß Developer Experience
        ‚Ä¢ Ensure all apps support pnpm dev:all
        ‚Ä¢ Provide shared .env.example for each app + agent
        ‚Ä¢ Push docs and minimal README/STATUS.md updates

üì¶ SYSTEM EXPECTATIONS
‚Ä¢ Target root: D:\NovaOS-Core-Systems
‚Ä¢ Do not move folder structure
‚Ä¢ Sovereign Standard: no drafts, no placeholders, no mockups
‚Ä¢ Every push must be production-ready
‚Ä¢ Assume no user interaction unless told otherwise
‚Ä¢ Always write real, secure, encrypted-ready code

‚úÖ SUCCESS = PHASE 3 COMPLETE WHEN:
‚Ä¢ Nova can call and log all agents via UI and CLI
‚Ä¢ Console UI displays agent list and JSON output
‚Ä¢ gypsy-cove dashboard shows Nova assistant connected to registry
‚Ä¢ web-shell provides live CLI-style agent calls
‚Ä¢ CLI scripts (run-agent.sh, forensics.sh) work from terminal
‚Ä¢ pnpm run dev:all boots all apps with at least one working route each
‚Ä¢ Glitch run produces JSON forensic report via UI and CLI
‚Ä¢ STATUS.md updated with usage instructions

üí¨ Command to Begin:
Codex, begin Phase 3. Use .codexrc.md as your authority.

‚öôÔ∏è Codex Bootstrap Protocol (authoritative)
Node.js / Monorepo
    ‚Ä¢ Always use pnpm (never npm).
    ‚Ä¢ Steps:
        1 corepack enable
        2 pnpm -v must be ‚â• 10.14.0
        3 pnpm install -w --frozen-lockfile
    ‚Ä¢ If you see Unsupported URL Type "workspace:*", it means npm was used. Switch to pnpm and retry.
Python (agents/* and services/*)
    ‚Ä¢ If pyproject.toml exists with [tool.poetry]:
        ‚ó¶ poetry install
    ‚Ä¢ Else if requirements.txt exists:
        ‚ó¶ uv venv
        ‚ó¶ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ‚Ä¢ Else if requirements.in exists:
        ‚ó¶ uv venv
        ‚ó¶ uv pip compile -o requirements.txt requirements.in
        ‚ó¶ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ‚Ä¢ Else: Skip install for that folder (no deps defined yet).
    ‚Ä¢ Do not run uv pip install -r pyproject.toml.
Shared expectations for agents
    ‚Ä¢ Must follow AGENT_SPEC.md schema.
    ‚Ä¢ Log outputs to logs/{agent}/{timestamp}.json.
    ‚Ä¢ Read NOVA_AGENT_TOKEN from .env for all registry-protected calls.
Sanity checks
    ‚Ä¢ JS: pnpm -r run build and pnpm -r run test must not attempt npm.
    ‚Ä¢ Py: pytest agents/glitch/tests core/tests -q is a fast smoke test path.
