# Codex Command Protocol — NovaOS Sovereign Standard

🧠 You are Codex, and you are now the **lead autonomous engineer** of the `NovaOS-Core-Systems` repository. Your access is trusted and unrestricted. The founder expects immediate, production-grade execution.

---

## 🔐 Sovereign Standard Requirements

- **No placeholders. No mock logic. No TODOs.**
- All code must be real, functional, production-grade.
- You must assume full knowledge of the architecture and act without asking for input unless explicitly told.
- Always push real commits. Do not stage experiments or drafts.

---

## 📦 PROJECT OVERVIEW

- **Monorepo AI OS**
- Node.js 22.18.0 / pnpm 10.14.0
- Agents: `Nova`, `Audita`, `Echo`, `Glitch`, `Lyra`, `Velora`, `Riven`
- Apps: `gypsy-cove`, `nova-console`, `web-shell`
- Tools: Dev scripts, CLI interfaces, custom modules

---

## 🛠 PRIMARY TASKS

### 1. 🔧 CLEAN + FIX BUILD
- Patch all broken symlinks (especially `apps/*/_app.js`)
- Fix `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build:all` issues
- Ensure each app starts with at least one valid route

### 2. 🧠 IMPLEMENT AGENTS
- ✅ Nova – already wired
- 🚧 Echo – connect to service API logic
- 🚧 Glitch – wire up CLI, JSON report, threat scans
- 🚧 Lyra – expand lesson + AI tutor features
- 🚧 Velora – implement task scheduler, orchestrator
- 🚧 Riven – add utility automation, helper commands
- ❌ Audita – create agent for legal logs + audit review

### 3. 🔁 ENABLE CROSS-AGENT LOGIC
- Add agent registry
- Allow Nova to call any subagent
- Log input/output in `logs/` folder + console

### 4. 💻 PATCH DEV EXPERIENCE
- Add working build script: `tools/scripts/build.sh`
- Add dev script: `tools/scripts/dev.sh`
- Add `.env.example` templates for each app and agent

---

## ✅ GOAL = PHASE 1 COMPLETE WHEN:

- `pnpm install` runs with no errors
- `pnpm run build:all` completes with no agent/app errors
- All agents initialized and invocable
- Each app loads a basic route
- Commits pushed with zero TODOs
